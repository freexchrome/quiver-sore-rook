# Building

Ever since I was a little kid photography always played a role in my
life. Photography helps me capture the way I see things through my
eyes.I have always been Amazed by the many beautiful things I see just
walking around my neighborhood. So these 6 images that I've picked are
some of my favorites because just walking around where I live I
captured these beauties.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This file is where I coded everything for the website

← `about.html`: This file is where I coded the part where i was talking about myself in the website

← `project.html`: This file is where i imported the images i wanted to put in my website

← `contact.html`: This file is where i coded a section in website to contact me

←`singlepage.html`:

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
