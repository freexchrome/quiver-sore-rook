# Building

Ever since I was a little kid photography always played a role in my
life. Photography helps me capture the way I see things through my
eyes.I have always been Amazed by the many beautiful things I see just
walking around my neighborhood. So these 6 images that I've picked are
some of my favorites because just walking around where I live I
captured these beauties.

← `index.html`:

← `about.html`:

← `project.html`:

← `contact.html`:

←`singlepage.html`:

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.
